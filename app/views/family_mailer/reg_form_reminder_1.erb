Dear Parents,

You are being sent this email because you have not completed the
registration for one or more of your K-7 students.   To date, we have 
received only about 330 online registrations out of a possible 850 for 
the District.  At Kent, it is very important for us to have the student 
information on a timely basis as we can't begin to place students until 
we know that they are planning to return to the Kentfield School District 
next fall.  If students are returning, we need information regarding 
their choice of classes as outlined in the registration process.  As 
of May 27, we will begin calling each family who has not completed the 
registration process.  You can save us a lot of time by taking a minute 
to complete the entire registration form for your child(ren).

SAVE THIS EMAIL!  While we want to capture registration information
before this school year ends, you can use this same link, login and
password to update your information at any time during the school
year.

  1. Go to the PowerSchool Parent website at 
     http://ps.kentfieldschools.org

  2. Enter the user name and password for each student currently in grades 
     kindergarten through seven to be registered (see below).

  3. After logging in, click the Class Registration icon to go the 
     Registration System.
   
  4. Read and follow the instructions for completing all the pages
     of the registration form.

  5. If you have more than one student returning to Bacich or Kent next 
     year, you will need to log in separately for each student. 
     The usernames for each student will be different.
