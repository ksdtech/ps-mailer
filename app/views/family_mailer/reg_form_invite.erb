To the <%= @family.last_name %> Family:

Following is a link that will connect you with the Kentfield School
District's online registration system.  We moved registration online
in an attempt to minimize the use of paper AND streamline the effort
of filling out multiple school forms requesting similar information.

The information contained within this system comes directly from our
PowerSchool student information database.  Please review and validate
all information and update our records as necessary.  We need the
information completed no later than Tuesday, May 20th.  This process
should take no longer than 15 minutes per child if most of the 
information is current.

If your student/s will not be returning to Bacich or Kent in the Fall
of 2008-2009, you have to fill out only Page 1 of the online registration
form, so that we will have an accurate count of returning students.

SAVE THIS EMAIL!  While we want to capture registration information
before this school year ends, you can use this same link, login and
password to update your information at any time during the school
year.

  1. Go to the PowerSchool Parent website at 
     http://ps.kentfieldschools.org

  2. Enter the username and password for each of
     your students currently in grades kindergarten through seven:

<%= @family.student_info %>
  3. After logging in, click the Class Registration icon to go the 
     Registration System.
   
  4. Read and follow the instructions for completing all the pages
     of the registration form.

  5. If you have more than one student returning to Bacich or Kent next 
     year, you will need to log in separately for each student. 
     The usernames for each student will be different.

As always, feel free to email your questions and suggestions to:
